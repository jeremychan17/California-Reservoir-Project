# California-Reservoir-Project
This is an independent honors project started during the spring quarter of my senior year of college. The aim of this project is to visualize water levels for eleven selected California reservoirs and create 12 month forecasts for each reservoir. A final report can be found in the "report" folder and the code can be found in the "Final RMD and Scripts"  folder in the "Reservoir Data" folder. This project was created in R.
