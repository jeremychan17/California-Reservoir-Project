# California-Reservoir-Project
This is an independent honors project started during the spring quarter of my senior year of college. The aim of this project is to visualize water levels for eleven selected California reservoirs and create 12 month time series forecasts for each reservoir. A final report can be found in the "report" folder and the code can be found in the "Final RMD and Scripts" folder in the "Reservoir Data" folder. This project was created in R. 

Currently, the code is mostly finished and most of the changes will be adding to my final report. 

Ideas for future exploration: SARIMA models, Modeling trend with exponential fits instead of linear fits, Testing the forecasts for other years, Spatio-temporal analysis, Streamlining code, Automated data cleaning
