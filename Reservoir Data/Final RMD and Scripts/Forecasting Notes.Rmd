This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

OLD STUFF
```{r}

shasta = CDECquery("SHA", 15, interval = "M", "1900-01-01", Sys.Date())
shasta$cap = shasta$value/4552000 * 100
model = fit.model(shasta)
fc = produce_forecasts(model)
forecastplot(shasta)
forecast.all(shasta)

oroville = CDECquery("ORO", 15, interval = "M", "1900-01-01", Sys.Date())
oroville$cap = oroville$value/3537577 * 100
model_o = fit.model(oroville)
fc = produce_forecasts(model_o)
forecastplot(oroville)
forc = forecast.all(oroville)

folsom = CDECquery("FOL", 15, interval = "M", "1900-01-01", Sys.Date())
folsom$cap = folsom$value/977000 * 100
forc2 = forecast.all(folsom)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
